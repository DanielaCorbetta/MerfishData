Description: MerfishData is an ExperimentHub package that serves publicly available
    datasets obtained with Multiplexed Error-Robust Fluorescence in situ Hybridization
    (MERFISH). MERFISH is a massively multiplexed single-molecule imaging technology
    capable of simultaneously measuring the copy number and spatial distribution
    of hundreds to tens of thousands of RNA species in individual cells. The scope
    of the package is to provide MERFISH data for benchmarking and analysis.
